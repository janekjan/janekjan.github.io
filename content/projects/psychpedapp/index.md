PsychPedApp is a bespoke timetabling and online register system for a mental health clinic in Warsaw.

Project is developed together with [Bartosz](https://github.com/ZyndramZM). The software stack is: **Python** with **Flask** library; database is managed with **SQLAlchemy**. It has been deployed and used since September 2022 in production. The production environment is a containerised **FreeBSD** installation with **MySQL** database. The software is maintained and extended as required by the clinic, with latest features added in Summer 2023.

As the project has been done as a bespoke solution, unfortunaltely neither the source, nor the program itself are available. Please contact me if you want to work on some similar open source project or if you need a bespoke solution like this.
