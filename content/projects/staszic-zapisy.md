Staszic-Zapisy is an office hours sign-up system developed for my high school. It has been used in production since early 2019. It was built using **Flask** and **SQLite** in a group of 3 as a school project.

The code is not free to use or modify, but it's source is available to the public at LINK. Since I developed it while still in high school, oh dear, my coding style there was not great.

## Features

The features of the system include:
* Ability to sign up to a specific slot of a specific teacher
* E-mail reminder for attendees and teachers, including possibility to cancel an appointment using a link. 
* Printable report with meetings timetable
* Spam prevention using CAPTCHA
* Admin panel
