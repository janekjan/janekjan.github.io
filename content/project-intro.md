## Other things I did

* Helped edit [this series of articles on Brainf**k CPU](https://dev.to/olus2000/series/12820), by [alsabak](https://olus2000.pl).
* Here's [my mediocre linux desktop setup](void_setup.md), nothing to brag about, really. I've been using it daily since 2019. I use void, [btw](https://voidlinux.org) (in fact I like it so much I'm ashamed I haven't started contributing to it yet).
* My home server is cool, at least in theory. (Will do a write-up about it later).
