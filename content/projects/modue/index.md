Modue is a startup that aims to create an innovative prosumer modular audio mixer. 

In the early stages I was responsible for creating a companion computer application for the device, as well as a library that abstracts calls to system libraries for a cross-platform experience. I also participated in the development of an USB driver. The technologies used were **Go** and **GTK+** for the desktop application, **C++** for interfacing with system libraries and **libusb** for the USB driver. 

Although we since parted ways, I wish the project all the best. You can track their progress at LINK.
