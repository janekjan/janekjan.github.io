## Other things I did

* Helped edit [this series of articles on Brainf**k CPU](https://dev.to/olus2000/series/12820), by [alsabak](olus2000.pl).
* I use void, [btw](https://voidlinux.org) Here's [my mediocre setup](void_setup.md), nothing to brag about, really. In fact I like it so much I'm ashamed I haven't started contributing to it yet.
* My home server is cool, at least in theory.
